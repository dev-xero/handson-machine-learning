## Notes

1. Correlation coefficient only measures linear correlations, so it's hard to get accurate insight on non-linear relationships.

2. The first step in preparing data for Machine Learning algorithms often is cleaning.

3. Imputation is when you set missing values from a dataset to zero, or the mean/median.
